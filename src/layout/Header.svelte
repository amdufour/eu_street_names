        <p class="introduction">
          Did you know that the history of European names goes back thousands of
          years and is rooted in various cultural and linguistic traditions?
          Back in the day, people would often pick names based on their
          occupation, location, or family lineage. So if you were a blacksmith,
          your name might be "Smith," or if you lived near a river, you could be
          called "River" or "Ford."
